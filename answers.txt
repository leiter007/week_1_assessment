#WEEK 1 TECH INTERVIEW#

#1. Variable
    felix = 'variable'

    Other datatypes
    - string = "felix"
    - boolean = true/false
    - integer
    - floats
    - arrays
    - hashes

#2. Hashes and arrays
    - Done in IRB

#3. Hashes and arrays
    - Done in separate folder and file, but code below:

    ```
class Car
    attr_accessor :color, :paint
    def initialize
        @color = "black"
    end

    def paint(color)
        @color = color
    end
end
```

#4. Rspec
    Q1:
    - First you create a Gemfile and add rspec as dependency
    - Then you run bundle install in your terminal
    - The you initiate rspec with: rspec --init
    - This creates a hidden .rspec file, as well as a spec folder - to store all tests - and a spec_helper ruby file

    Q2:
    - Due to the benefits of Test Driven Development:
        1. It ensures the implemented code is fit for it's purpose
        2. It makes us more efficient as developers, since it forces us to think about what we want our code to do before we start implementing.
        3. It reduces debugging time, since development is done incrementally with tests (hopefully) passing as we code along
        4. In difference to documentation/instructions, testing doesn't get old - it is always monitoring how your code works
        5. In summary, it ensures our code is sustainable and made to last!

    Q3 + Q4
    - Done in separate folder and file
